# Installation

(Should need to install. Should just be able to run a compiled exe?)

# Installation steps for development:

tldr; just run this:
```
git clone https://github.com/daniel-103/capstone-project.git
cd capstone-project
npm install
npm start
```
## Step by step

Download or clone the repository using:
```
git clone https://github.com/daniel-103/capstone-project.git
```

Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager). Node.js is required for npm (Node Package Manager) to download the required libraries. Once Node is installed, run the following in the newly created repository's directory to download the necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Start the application with:
```
npm start
```

or, alternatively, start the application in dev mode to enable certain tools:
```
npm run dev
```

For developement, use electronmon to automatically refresh the application after saving a file. This runs the application in dev mode and prevents having to manually close and relaunch it after every change:
```
npx electronmon .
```

(Add anything else that might be needed.)
