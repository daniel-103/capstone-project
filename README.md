# Installation

(Should just be an exe?)

# Installation steps for development:

tldr; just run this:
```
git clone https://github.com/daniel-103/capstone-project.git
cd capstone-project
npm install electron electron-builder --save-dev
```
## Step by step

Download or clone the repository using:
```
git clone https://github.com/daniel-103/capstone-project.git
```

Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager). Node.js is needed to use npm (Node Package Manager) to download the required libraries. Once Node is installed, run the following in the repository's directory:
```
npm install electron electron-builder --save-dev
```
The electron and electron-builder packages are only needed during the build process, so `--save-dev` is used.

(Add any more things that might be needed.)
