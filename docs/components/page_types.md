# Page Types
A description of what page types are, how they work, and how to use them.

## How they work
When you opena project, the way in which you view information is through pages. So page types are essentially templates
the user can utilize to start organizing information. THese page types are stores both in the project itself and 
in a place in the database that all projects can access. This allows the types to be both unique by the project
and for the user to be able to all or delete page types while considering the page types of all projects.

## How to use them

# Creating a Page from a Page Type
There is an icon at the top left of the header buttons at the immediate top of the file hierarchy. Clicking this button will
show a menu of all availible page types. These are the page types assigned to the current project you are in. Clicking on
one of these will create a page using the template associated with that page type.

# Manipulating Page Types
If you want to create a page type from a page you already have, you can right click on the page (if it's a page with modules) 
and click "Save as Page Type". This will add a page type whose name is the name of the current page to the list of page
types.

To add or delete page types that already exist, click "File" and "Project Types". This will take you to a page where you will see two
lists, "All Types" and "Project Types". The all types list shows all the page types in the database, and project types shows 
all the types associated with the current project. TO add types to the current project, click the add button in the all types 
list. To delete a page type from a project, click the delete button under project types. To delete the type from both the database
and the current project, click delte under all types. THis will delete this page type permanantly.
