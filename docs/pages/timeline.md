The timeline allows user to view events of the story in the form of a timeline while 
filtering the events by the year adn whatever attributes are associated with events.

The Include and Ignore search filters allow users to type in an attribute of the
event (location, character, chapter, ect.) along with the exact value (Paris, Tom, 1, ect.)
If it is in the "include" list, the events that have the specified value will be
included in the timeline, with the opposite being true for the 'ignore' list. There
are autocomplete options for these attributes and values, and the user must select the
autocomplete option for it to register and be added to the list.

The timeline itself displays all events that meet the conditions, ordered by year with
the location of the events on the timeline being proportional to the span of years
the timeline is displaying (i.e. max year - min year). When hovering over an
event, more information about that event is displayed.
