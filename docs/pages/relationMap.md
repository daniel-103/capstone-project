## Overview
The relationship map displays all of the current characters and the relationships they have with one another. Characters appear as nodes and the relationships as a line connecting the nodes. 

## Script
Uses the nodeGraphScript.js for the nodeGraph module in node_relations.js. 

## To Do
Still need to implement saving and loading of the nodes and the page. 

Want to implement different colors and text for different types of relationships (friend, enemy, faction member). Would also like to implement a per faction relationship map.
